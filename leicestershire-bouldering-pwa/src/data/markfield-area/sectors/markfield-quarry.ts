  overview: `A granite quarry turned nature reserve. The climbing here feels very different to that of the volcanic tuff at Cademan or the slate-like rock around Woodhouse Eaves. 

The bouldering is mostly located on the upper-tier of the quarry. There are three main areas. Overhanging Wall has the hardest problems in Leicestershire outside Forest Rock. The upper tier beyond the fence has recently been developed and gives some bouldering in the f7s, but be careful if you decide to cross it. In contrast to these, Upper Betty's Slab is home to some easier slabby bouldering.

​Markfield is also home to Leicestershire's finest deep water solo route: Baptism VS 5b (non-swimmers can take E3). Unfortunately the traditional way to access this route is now overgrown with gorse so you will need to approach via the water.

There are a number of trad routes in the quarry which are not documented here.`,
  conditions: ``,
  approach: `Park courteously next to Saint Michael's Church on The Green, Markfield LE67 9WD. There is also a car park on Hill Lane, though it has been reported that cars have been broken into here.
  
  Walk up Mill Hill Lane. Follow the footpath up the hill, when you see the information board on your left continue straight to descend into the quarry bowl. The boulder problems are on walls on the eastern edge of the quarry. ​Accessing some of the problems will involve crossing the fence. `,
