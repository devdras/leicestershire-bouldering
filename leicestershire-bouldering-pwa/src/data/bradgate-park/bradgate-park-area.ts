  overview: `Area in Leicestershire.`,
  conditions: `Bradgate Park contains four crags: The Stable Pit, Wishing Stone Crag, Sliding Stone Crag and Memorial Crag. Wishing Stone Crag is the most beautiful spot, boasting the best problems and overlooking the area of the park known as Little Matlock. The Stable Pit has the best landings and the most problems, though is reasonably high in places. Sliding Stone Crag is more esoteric but not without interest. Memorial Crag has been climbed on in the past but is home to rare fossils and park and council authorities would prefer if climbers kept off.

The ruins of Bradgate House and Old John tower are the two non-climbing landmarks worth seeing. Herds of deer roam the park and you are likely to encounter these as you walk around.

Parking is pay and display £3 for all day on week days and £4 on weekends and bank holidays. Entry is free. Expect to get asked what your bouldering pads are by the curious walkers. There are two cafes, one at the south east corner and one in the south west, but these are quite expensive. Toilets are located in each of the car parks.`,
