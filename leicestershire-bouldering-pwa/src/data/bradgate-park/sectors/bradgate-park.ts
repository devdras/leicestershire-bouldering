ref SK 534100 (its on the join of sheets 129 and 140). The rock is slate quartzite. The pit
faces south and is relatively secluded.`,

  approach: `If you are heading to Cavalry Rock or Hidden wall there may be parking where
  Turolough Road meets Car Hill Road. However, parking here is limited. Alternatively,
  park on Grace Dieu road and approach as for Grimley's Rock (page 32). If you know
  the area well it would be best to approach all areas as for Grimley's to keep the
  parking spaces free for others. Note: Local residents are becoming frustrated with
  people parking on the sides of Turolough Road. Please park as for Grimley's Rock,
  on Grace Dieu Road, if the parking bays are full. `,
  access: `Activities in the Park are managed by County Hall and have been increasingly restricted in recent times. Climbing on the rocks is not actually forbidden by the displayed Bye Laws - although climbing the trees, walls and buildings is.

The warden has been known to say that climbing is forbidden after the volume of public complaints (another Bye Law says you can't do anything that produces complaints).`,
